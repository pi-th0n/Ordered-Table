# Ordered-Table
Takes user input and makes a table ordered by name, year of birth, or user ID.

The user input would look something like this: (obviously you won't paste this and rather would input it one at a time.
```
[
    [name3, DOB (year), ID (10 characters)],
    [name5, DOB (year), ID (10 characters)],
    [name1, DOB (year), ID (10 characters)],
    [name2, DOB (year), ID (10 characters)],
    [name4, DOB (year), ID (10 characters)]
]
```

And the output would look something like this.

```
+-------+------+---------------+
| Name1 | year | ID (10 chars) |
+-------+------+---------------+
| Name2 | year | ID (10 chars) |
+-------+------+---------------+
| Name3 | year | ID (10 chars) |
+-------+------+---------------+
| Name4 | year | ID (10 chars) |
+-------+------+---------------+
| Name5 | year | ID (10 chars) |
+-------+------+---------------+
```
Try it out :) It will make more sense one you do so.
